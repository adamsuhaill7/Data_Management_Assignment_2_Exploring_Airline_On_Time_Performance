## üìä Dataset Background
Hello GitHub enthusiasts! My name is Adam, and I'm a master's student in Data Science. For my fourth entry in my GitHub repository, I have chosen to explore and analyze a dataset related to airline on-time performance, which is a crucial aspect of modern transportation. The dataset, collected from the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo, contains nearly **120 million records** detailing flight arrival and departure information for major carriers within the USA from **1987 to 2008**.

You can access the dataset here: [Kaggle: Airline On-Time Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com).

In this project, we will specifically focus on the year **2005**. The total number of datasets included in the analysis will be:
- **airports.csv** ‚Üí `airport_data`
- **carriers.csv** ‚Üí `carrier_data`
- **plane-data.csv** ‚Üí `plane_data`
- **2005.csv** ‚Üí `flight_data`

## üåç Introduction
This analysis aims to explore airline on-time performance using a dataset from the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo, specifically focusing on **2005** flight data from major US carriers. The objectives are:

1. **Delay Patterns**:
   - Identify times of day with the lowest average delays.
   - Determine which days of the week have better on-time performance.
   - Analyze the months or seasons when flights are most likely to be on time.

2. **Delay Factors**:
   - Rank the top 3-5 factors contributing to flight delays.
   - Quantify the impact of each factor in terms of delay minutes and percentage of total delays.

3. **Cancellation Analysis**:
   - Identify primary reasons for flight cancellations.
   - Investigate correlations between cancellations, airlines, airports, and time periods.

4. **Problematic Routes**:
   - Identify routes, carriers, or flight numbers with consistent performance issues.
   - Analyze reasons for delays or cancellations on these flights.

This analysis seeks to provide insights into airline operations and improve the travel experience for passengers.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
In recent years, airline on-time performance has garnered increasing attention, particularly in the context of delays and cancellations that affect travelers. This analysis seeks to address several key issues related to the efficiency of airline operations, focusing on how various factors‚Äîsuch as time of day, weather conditions, and aircraft age‚Äîimpact flight delays and cancellations.

### üîç Main Problems or Hypotheses:
- **Delay Patterns**: What times of day, days of the week, and seasons are associated with the lowest average delays?
  - **Guiding Questions**:
    - How do delays vary across different times of day (morning, afternoon, evening)?
    - Which days of the week show better on-time performance?

- **Impact of Delay Factors**: What are the primary factors contributing to flight delays?
  - **Guiding Questions**:
    - Which delay categories (e.g., carrier delays, weather delays) have the most significant impact on overall flight delays?
    - How can the impact of each delay factor be quantified in terms of minutes of delay and percentage of total delays?

- **Cancellation Analysis**: What are the primary reasons for flight cancellations, and how do they correlate with specific airlines or airports?
  - **Guiding Questions**:
    - What cancellation codes are most frequently reported, and what do they indicate?
    - Are there specific airlines or airports that show higher cancellation rates?

- **Problematic Routes**: Which specific routes (origin-destination pairs) and carriers demonstrate consistently poor performance?
  - **Guiding Questions**:
    - What are the common characteristics of routes with high delay and cancellation rates?
    - What underlying factors contribute to the poor performance of these routes?

By exploring these problems and guiding questions, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the operational challenges faced by airlines, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve on-time performance and enhance the overall travel experience for passengers.
